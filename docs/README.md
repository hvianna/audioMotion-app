## About

![audioMotion-header](img/audioMotion-header.png)

> **audioMotion** is a high-resolution real-time audio spectrum analyzer and full-featured music player that lets you **see your music!** â™ªâ™«ðŸ¤©<br>
> It is completely free, open-source software, created out of my passion for the graphic spectrum analyzers of hi-fi systems from the 1980s.

## Features

* High-resolution real-time dual channel audio spectrum analyzer
* Fullscreen and Picture-In-Picture support at 60fps, ready for retina / HiDPI displays
* Logarithmic, linear and perceptual (Bark and Mel) frequency scales, with customizable range
* Visualization of discrete FFT frequencies or up to 240 frequency bands (supports ANSI and equal-tempered octave bands)
* Decibel and linear amplitude scales, with customizable sensitivity
* Optional A, B, C, D and ITU-R 468 weighting filters
* Optional effects: vintage LEDs, variable opacity, mirroring and reflection, radial visualization
* 17 beautiful color gradients, plus a visual editor to easily create your own gradients
* HTML5 audio player for MP3, AAC (m4a), OGG and FLAC files (support may vary depending on browser and operating system)
* Visual file explorer and play queue with drag-and-drop functionality
* Support for M3U playlists (`m3u` and `m3u8` file extensions)
* Visualize audio from your microphone (or "stereo mix", if your soundcard supports it)
* Lightweight custom file server â€” also works on standard web servers with minimal configuration
* Client runs on any modern browser (tested on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari)

## Demo

> â–¶ **[https://demo.audiomotion.me](https://demo.audiomotion.me)**

The demo site includes a few sample songs, radio streams and background images and videos ([credits here](#resources-used-in-the-demo-site)).

You can also upload audio files from your PC and use the microphone input.

## Getting started

Download the latest version from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion.js/releases/latest).

Binaries are available for Windows, Linux and macOS (Intel x64) - these are not signed, so you'll get the usual warnings from your operating system.

Verify the integrity of binaries using the commands below. Check the generated checksums against the ones provided in the release page.

+ Windows:
```
certutil -hashfile "audioMotion-23.8.0 Setup" md5
certutil -hashfile "audioMotion-23.8.0 Setup" sha256
```

+ Linux:
```
md5sum filename
sha256sum filename
```

+ MacOS:
```
md5 filename
shasum -a 256 filename
```

?> You don't need binaries to run **audioMotion** in a web browser. Check [Running as a Web App](webapp.md) for more information.

If you want to build your own binaries, check the [Building](building.md) page.
